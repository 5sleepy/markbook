# markbook
 
Designed for my client (HL math teacher) to use to speed up her grading conversion process. 

Problem: Converting from Ontario marks (0-100) to IB marks (1-7) is tedious and repetitive. In addition, my client's use of a paper-based format to handle marks prompted a switch to an electronic version.

Solution: Markbook. Stores individual student scores, handles weightings for individual assessment types in accordance with IB's HL Math (papers 1-3) and returns both appropriate Ontario and IB marks, as desired. Additionally, the data is encrypted, and users must log in to access it. It's hosted locally and runs in a web-based format.
